## Title
- Joint prediction and accuracy enhancement （JPAE） methods for deep regression learning considering the relationship between point and intervals

## Description of the files
- 1) _Result_evalute.py_：A function for evaluating the effectiveness of prediction interval estimation and point prediction accuracy
- 2)  _Proposed.py_：The proposed method. Take the Energy task as an example.


## Contribution
- 1) An asynchronous training strategy for joint point-interval prediction model with threshold monitoring and parameter sharing is devised, where interval prediction is distribution-free, and the added parts can be combined with any DRL in plug-in form;
- 2) A fuzzy logic-based point accuracy improvement method is proposed, which can guarantee the calibration of point prediction results with certain interpretability.
